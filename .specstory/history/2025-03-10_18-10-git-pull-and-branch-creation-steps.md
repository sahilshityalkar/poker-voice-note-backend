To pull a specific commit and create a new branch from it, you can follow these steps:

1. **Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. **Check out the specific commit**:
   ```bash
   git checkout ab35ec7e23776d024067ac218e98d4564aec77fe
   ```

3. **Create a new branch from that commit**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
   ```

4. **Start working on your new branch**.

### Summary of Commands
```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout ab35ec7e23776d024067ac218e98d4564aec77fe
git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
```

Replace `your-new-branch-name` with the desired name for your new branch. After these steps, you will be on your new branch, and you can start making changes.
